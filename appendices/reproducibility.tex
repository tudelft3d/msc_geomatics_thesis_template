\chapter{Reproducibility self-assessment}

To promote open science and research integrity, please include a statement about the reproducibility of your MSc thesis work. 

Address the following points concisely:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Availability:} Is your data (that you used as input, or that you generated) publicly accessible? If yes, provide a persistent link (ideally a DOI, you can archive our datasets on GitHub or in the 4TU repository); if no, briefly explain why not (\eg\ privacy, licensing).
  \item \textbf{Code Availability:} Is your code and analysis workflow openly available? This can be for instance via GitHub, OSF, Zenodo. Include the relevant link or DOI if applicable. It is suggested to follow those guidelines for reproducibility: \url{https://geomatics.bk.tudelft.nl/geogeeks/git/goodgit/}.
  \item \textbf{Documentation:} Have you provided clear instructions, README files, or notebooks so others can understand and reproduce your results?
  \item \textbf{Reproducibility Rating:} Self-rate your overall reproducibility using the following scale:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{High:} All data and code fully available, well-documented, and tested to reproduce main results.
      \item \textbf{Moderate:} Most data and code available, basic documentation, some steps may require clarification.
      \item \textbf{Low:} Limited or no data/code sharing, minimal documentation, reproduction unlikely.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Example statement:}

\begin{quote}
All data and analysis code related to this thesis are openly accessible at \texttt{[insert link]}. Complete instructions and a sample workflow are provided in the project README. I rate the reproducibility of this thesis as \textbf{High} according to the provided scale.
