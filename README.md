# MSc Geomatics final thesis template (LaTeX)

A complete LaTeX template for the [MSc Geomatics](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl) thesis.

It contains all the parts that are required and is structured in such a way that most/all supervisors expect.
Observe that the MSc Geomatics at TU Delft has no formal requirements, how the document looks like (fonts, margins, headers, etc) is entirely up to you. 

We basically took the template *KOMA-Script scrbook*, added the front/back matters (cover page, copyright, abstract, etc.), and gave examples for the insertion of figures, tables and algorithms.

> It is not an official template and it is not mandatory to use it. But we hope it will encourage everyone to use LaTeX for writing their thesis, and we also hope that it will *greatly discourage* some from using Word.


## How to get started with LaTeX?

Follow the [Overleaf's Learn LaTeX in 30min](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) to start.

The only crucial thing missing from it is how to add references, for this we suggest you use "natbib" ([tutorial about bibliography management with natbib](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib)).
