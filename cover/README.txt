The cover (front + back) must be manually updated with your details and own figure.

To do so, you must either:
  - edit the PDF directly in Illustrator;
  - use the PSD files in Illustrator, edit them and export to PDF; (I haven't tested them, just exported from another software)
  - use the afdesign file if you have a Mac and the software Affinity Designer (https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/); great but not free.

If your figure has lighter colours, use the black logo of TU Delft provided.

The font of the title is the TU Delft font ('TU Delft UltraLight') that is not installed by default on your system. It's free to download:
